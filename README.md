#### Harvard Medical School - Department of Biomedical Informatics - Boston, MA

## Workshop Structure

This workshop is divided in 3 modules: 

### 1. **HAIL 101:**

  - Deploying clusters
  - Basic concepts 
  - Hail data structure and functions
  - Aggregations
  - Basic plotting 

### 2. **GWAS in 5 steps**

###  3. **Variant browsing, discovery and annotation**

Sample code from each module can be found at the `notebooks` folder.

## `Hail`
All the related documentation for `Hail` can be found at [their website](<https://hail.is/index.html>). Hail has two main data representations: [**Table**](<https://hail.is/docs/0.2/hail.Table.html#hail.Table>) and [**MatrixTable**](<https://hail.is/docs/0.2/overview/matrix_table.html>). This is how data is stored and it's important to learn all their features and characteristics. In addition, the [Overview page](<https://hail.is/docs/0.2/overview/index.html>) is always a good starting point for new users.  

Please note that the production release is [`version 0.2`](<https://hail.is/docs/0.2/index.html>). There are a [Forum](<https://discuss.hail.is/>) and a [Chat](<https://hail.zulipchat.com/login/>) available for support and to interact with the `Hail` community.

## Useful terminology

**Cloud computing**: he practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the Internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than a local server or a personal computer
